Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location



Your challenge is to build out this IP Address Tracker app and get it looking as close 
to the design as possible. To get the IP Address locations, you'll be using the [IP Geolocation API 
by IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/). To generate the map, we recommend using 
[LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/).


⚠️ **IMPORTANT** ⚠️: To use the IP Geolocation API by IPify, you'll need to sign up for a free 
account. You won't need to add any cards details to do this and it's a very quick process. This 
will generate an API Key for you. Usually, you would be able to restrict your API Key to a specific 
URL (your own domain). This makes sure that other people can't use your API Key on their own websites.
IPify doesn't have this feature, but because you aren't adding your card details, this isn't an issue. 
**So be sure to only sign up for the free account and DO NOT enter any card details**.

For the mapping API, we recommend using [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/). It's free to use and 
doesn't require an API Key. If you decide to use another API, like Google Maps or Mapbox, be sure to secure your API Key. Here are guides for both Google Maps and Mapbox, be sure to read through them thoroughly:

- [API Key best practices from Google Developers](https://developers.google.com/maps/api-key-best-practices)
- [How to use Mapbox securely](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/troubleshooting/how-to-use-mapbox-securely/)

Exposing your API Key publicly can lead to other people using it to make requests for their own 
application if the proper precautions aren't in place. Please be sure you read the guides thoroughly 
and follow their recommendations.
**We don't take any responsibility if you expose your API Key while completing the challenge and 
have not secured it.**
